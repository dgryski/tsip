tsip -- tiny sip-like hash
==========================

This repository has Go, amd64, C, and Rust implemtations of a small fast string
hashing function.

In 2016, in an effort to strengthen Perl's default string hashing function,
Yves Orton ( @demerphq ) and I started playing around with new hashes optimized
for short strings rather than bulk hashing.  Yves' work at
https://github.com/demerphq/BeagleHash ended up in Perl5
https://github.com/perl/perl5/commit/9d5e3f1aaa70db4a786eb6a7a3437e1e1d703204

This tsip is the result of my work at the time.   It didn't really go anywhere
but it was fun to play with. It passes smhasher and has reasonably good
performance.
